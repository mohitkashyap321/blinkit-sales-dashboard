I'm thrilled to present the Blinkit Analytics Dashboard using Power BI, a recent project I worked on. The purpose of this dashboard was to analyse important metrics and offer useful information.

Target: Using Power BI, develop a thorough sales dashboard for Blinkit with an emphasis on analysing important metrics and informing business choices.

Actions:

Data Collection: To guarantee thorough coverage of sales, outlet, and item information, data was gathered from a variety of trustworthy sources.

Cleaning and Loading Data: Data was imported into PowerBI. Eliminated unnecessary columns from the data to clean it up. Managing values that are missing. and changing the kinds of data.

Data analysis: It was done to find patterns in item popularity, outlet effectiveness, and sales performance.

Dashboard Creation: Using Power BI, I created interactive graphics that displayed important data, such as total sales, Average Rating and Average Sales. filters based on item type, size, and outlet location have been implemented to provide detailed insights.

KPIs:

$1.20 million in total sales.
$141 is the average sales per outlet.
3.9 is the average rating. 
8.523 items were sold.

Suggestions:

Increase product emphasis on best-selling items such as fruits and snacks.

To maximise the sales potential of medium and large outlets, expand them.

Invest more in marketing at Tier 3 locations to take advantage of strong sales.

Concluding remarks: Provided practical insights to improve customer satisfaction and streamline operations.
